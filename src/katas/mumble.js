/*
This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:

Examples:
accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"

Take a string, convert to array. Array +1 is our key.
convert each character to lower case.
.toUpper at the start. 
dashes seperate
convert back to string.
